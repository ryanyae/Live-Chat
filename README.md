# Live Chatting App (In-progress)

## Connect with your friends in live time

This project will be of a live chatting service that allows chatting between 2 people in live time. This application is designed for people that are seeking to connect with friends, family, etc. This app utilizes various different softwares. The front-end is made using React.js. While the backend is utlizing various frameworks such as Node.js, and Express.js. This app uses GraphQL for querying data from the back-end with the help of Apollo. This is a big jump for my previous project, Shop-app, where this is a solo project and how I decided to learn GraphQL with this project.
